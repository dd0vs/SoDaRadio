SoDa -- A Software Defined Radio for the Ettus Research USRP

Version 2.2

Minor updates to fix problems with unitialized data in 
the USRPCtrl object. 

Also fixed thread scheduling warning -- the program now works
for users that don't have RTPRIO privs. 

Thanks to an alert user for these reports. 

Note that some UBUNTU users have found that they must set
the UBUNTU_MENUPROXY to something in order to get pulldowns
to display.  UBUNTU is getting a little annoying. 
I do this (Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS) with 
export UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=libappmenu.so
Others running Ubuntu 14.04 do this:
export UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0

--------------

Version 2.1

This package builds two programs: 

SoDaServer -- a multithreaded program that implements a software
defined multimode VHF/UHF transciever.  

SoDaRadio -- a GUI that offers a user interface to the controls
for SoDaServer

There are several improvements over versions 1.1 and 1.2. 
Chief among these is a "band select" scheme that allows the
user to define band segments, and transverter settings. 

Before running this version, you should remove the file ~/.SoDaRadio/SoDa.soda_cfg as it is no longer compatible with version 2.0.  I really ought to fix that.


See the INSTALL file for instructions on configuring, building 
and installing SoDa


---- 

Prerequisites: 

Boost version 1.33 or later -- current builds are against boost 1.55
wxWidgets -- current build is against version 2.6
libuhd -- builds against version 003.007

INSTALL Quick Start  (X.x is the version that you just downloaded, 
e.g. soda-X.x.tar.gz might be soda-2.2.tar.gz...)

# unpack soda-X.x.tar.gz 
tar xzvf soda-X.x.tar.gz
cd soda-X.x
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
make install

HOWTO 

To start the radio, connect your Ettus USRP N2xx to 
the host computer. (I'm assuming that your USRP has a
WBX module.)  Connect an antenna to the TX/RX port.


Then execute SoDaRadio

(If you haven't installed SoDaRadio, but have built it, 
you can start SoDaRadio from the build directory like this: 

gui/SoDaRadio --server=src/SoDaRadio 

)

It should come up tuned to something like 162.55 or nearby. 

Poke buttons.  Try things.  Don't hit the "TX" button unless
you have something connected and the necessary license to operate
in that band.
