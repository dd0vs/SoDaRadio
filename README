SoDa -- A Software Defined Radio for the Ettus Research USRP

Version 2.0

This package builds two programs: 

SoDaServer -- a multithreaded program that implements a software
defined multimode VHF/UHF transciever.  

SoDaRadio -- a GUI that offers a user interface to the controls
for SoDaServer

There are several improvements over versions 1.1 and 1.2. 
Chief among these is a "band select" scheme that allows the
user to define band segments, and transverter settings. 

Before running this version, you should remove the file ~/.SoDaRadio/SoDa.soda_cfg as it is no longer compatible with version 2.0.  I really ought to fix that.


See the INSTALL file for instructions on configuring, building 
and installing SoDa

HOWTO 

To start the radio, connect your Ettus USRP N2xx to 
the host computer. (I'm assuming that your USRP has a
WBX module.)  Connect an antenna to the TX/RX port.


Then execute SoDaRadio

(If you haven't installed SoDaRadio, but have built it, 
you can start SoDaRadio from the build directory like this: 

gui/SoDaRadio --server=src/SoDaRadio 

)

It should come up tuned to something like 162.55 or nearby. 

Poke buttons.  Try things.  Don't hit the "TX" button unless
you have something connected.
