	* Fixed typo in TX signal path figure
	* Changed FM demodulators from differentiator based
	to atan based.  Audio quality is much improved. 

	* Added The SoDaRadio GUI now automatically starts
	the server.  If the server is not installed, you can
	tell SoDaRadio where to find the server with the --server
	command line switch: 

	gui/SoDaRadio --server=src/SoDaServer

	for instance, if you're running out of the build area. 

	* Added a default configuration that brings the radio
	up tuned to a national weather service station.  Config
	can now be saved to ${HOME}/.SoDaRadio and that's where
	we look first, unless the user supplies the --config
	command line switch to SoDaRadio.

	* released (soon) as soda-1.2
