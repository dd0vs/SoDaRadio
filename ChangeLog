	* wow.... not many updates to the ChangeLog since the conversion to Git.
	Changes from 3.5:
	* Addition of arduino sketches for hardware to do TR and bandswitching.
	* Added "serverargs" command line switch to gui -- argument is passed through to 
	the SoDaServer program.
	* Added "audio" switch to gui -- select the audio device for ALSA.
	* Added hardware schematic and layout files (eagle) for a B2xx TR switch module
	* Added hardware schematic and layout files (eagle) for a serial controlled
	TR and bandswitch that talks to the N200 through the GPS serial port.
	* Fixed audio gain problem where the original (up to 3.5) slider control would
	go from silent to ear-splitting in the first 1/4 of the range.
	* Added B200 and N200 TR switch control modules -- called by USRPCtrl
	* Added -intN and -fracN (force integer-N or fractional-N synthesis in
	the front-end) to the SoDaServer command line switches.
	* Changed tuning scheme in USRPCtrl to better avoid reference multiple spurs.
	* Cleaned up some of the sloppier code in USRPCtrl.
	* Started refactoring the front-end tuner code... not in use yet.
	* Fixed some problems in USRPCtrl that would likely crash on USRPs that
	have no front-end local oscillators (LFRX/LFTX/BASICRX/BASICTX). This
	code is as yet untested on such modules....  

2014-09-13 Matt Reilly kb1vc (kb1vc@kb1vc.org)
	* SVN 81
	* First support for B210 10GHz simple transverter see the Blog...
	at https://sourceforge.net/p/sodaradio/blog/
	* Added debug hooks and Debug class and --debug switch
	* Fixed problem where File->Load Configuration woult segfault
	* Fixed size problem in frequency display boxes
	
2014-06-07 Matt Reilly kb1vc (kb1vc@kb1vc.org)
	* SVN 64
	* added initialization for all member vars in USRPCtrl 
	to fix NAN trouble reported by a user.
	* bumped version to 2.2 ready for release.
	* update README

2014-05-18 Matt Reilly kb1vc (kb1vc@kb1vc.org)
	* Fixed problem in setting thread priority --
	use set_thread_priority_safe to avoid a thrown exception
	when the user does not have rtprio
	* Added HWMB_REP command type to report the motherboard type
	for the target radio
	* Added GET/REP handling in the GUI to get the MB type
	for the target radio and add it to the application frame title.

2014-04-21 Matt Reilly kb1vc (kb1vc@kb1vc.org)
	* Updates to support B2xx devices
	* Added --uhdargs switch to SoDaRadio gui -- allows specification
	of the target device to be passed to the Server
	* Fixed race between startup of server and gui connection to
	server sockets. 
	* released (soon) as soda-2.1
	

2014-02-19 Matt Reilly kb1vc (kb1vc@kb1vc.org)
	* Fixed typo in TX signal path figure
	* Changed FM demodulators from differentiator based
	to atan based.  Audio quality is much improved. 

	* Added The SoDaRadio GUI now automatically starts
	the server.  If the server is not installed, you can
	tell SoDaRadio where to find the server with the --server
	command line switch: 

	gui/SoDaRadio --server=src/SoDaServer

	for instance, if you're running out of the build area. 

	* Added a default configuration that brings the radio
	up tuned to a national weather service station.  Config
	can now be saved to ${HOME}/.SoDaRadio and that's where
	we look first, unless the user supplies the --config
	command line switch to SoDaRadio.

	* released (soon) as soda-1.2

	2014-02-15 Matt Reilly kb1vc (kb1vc@kb1vc.org)
	* add figures and pictures to the doc/figs and doc/pix
	directories.  These are used in doxygen generation
	* update Makefile.am, configure.ac, and m4 files to 
	support choice of libuhd library and include directories
	* Hooray! Hooray!  The new version of libuhd (003.007) supports
	Integer-N tuning for the front-end LO. Thank you to Ben and
	company at Ettus for implementing this useful feature. 
	* release as soda-1.1.1

	
2014-02-16 Matt Reilly kb1vc (kb1vc@kb1vc.org)
	* Remove spurious dependence on PortAudio
	* fixed portability problems wrt OSX, still peeling the onion
	* fixed resampler aliasing problem near nyquist limit. 
	* released as soda-1.1.1c


2014-02-14 Matt Reilly kb1vc (kb1vc@kb1vc.org)
