Loopback audio modifications

There are applications for SoDaRadio that require it to send
its audio to a loopback device so that another program can
process it (e.g. fldigi, wsjt...) and to listen on a loopback
device to handle audio produced by a second program.

ALSA isn't very helpful, and we're not going back to PA.

There are lots of ways to do fancy configuration in ALSA to
make this work, but alas, all of them are delicate, poorly documented,
irrational, and <rant> generally representative of the sorry state of linux
audio support. </endrant>

The simple thing would be to have AudioRX open two outbound ports, and
AudioTX open two inbound ports.   Sigh, that doesn't work for spit.
ALSA doesn't like two ports open from the same process.  

I could modify Audio?X to disconnect from one port and open another, and
that sounds like the simplest choice...

Sigh... none of this works.  ALSA is pretty frustrating.

How about Jack?
No.

I did get some audio from a loopback device into fldigi.

fldigi capture device Loopback: PCM(hw:0,1)
aplay -D hw:Loopback,0,0 -c 1 ~/test_fp8k.wav
Playing WAVE '/home/mhr/test_fp8k.wav' : Float 32 bit Little Endian, Rate 8000 Hz, Mono

after I set the sample rate explicitly to 48000, then I could do this:
aplay -D hw:Loopback,0,0 -c 1 ~/test_fp.wav
Playing WAVE '/home/mhr/test_fp.wav' : Float 32 bit Little Endian, Rate 48000 Hz, Mono

Then I did this:
mhr@i7 build]$ exp/Audio_test --out0 hw:Loopback,0,0 --out1 hw:Loopback,0,0
linux; GNU C++ version 5.3.1 20160406 (Red Hat 5.3.1-6); Boost_105800; UHD_003.009.004-0-g2b5a88bb

Wow!  the recv buffer isn't ready....

snd_pcm_avail returns EPIPE -- current state is SND_PCM_STATE_XRUN  ready_frames = -32
Exception caught in Audio_test:
	SoDa Object [AudioALSA ALSA Interface] threw exception [AudioALSA::wakeOut() Failed to wake after sleepOut() -- Broken pipe]


---------

It got some audio to FLDIGI, right where it should have been, but
then we failed on wakeup.... sigh.
This appears to be caused by the loopback channel running dry... This
seems to cause the PIPE to be closed and put in a state where we
can't recover. 

-----

OK there is a problem with snd_pcm_start where it returns EPIPE if
a loopback channel doesn't have data ready.  We don't care, so we
(along with lots of other folks, apparently) ignore the error return.

So, now I have something where we can pass a port name on the command
line to route all audio to a designated device.  This isn't exactly
satisfactory.

FLDIGI worked when configured with
configure->soundcard->devices->capture = loopback PCM(hw:0,1)
and SoDaradio was configured with
$ gui/SoDaRadio --audio_out hw:Loopback,0,0 --server=src/SoDaServer

Next, we'll work on audio_in

Well, this isn't going well at all.... do we need to switch to
PulseAudio?

No... we should use pulseaudio as the inter-switch.
[mhr@i7 src]$ sudo dnf install pulseaudio-utils alsa-plugins-pulseaudio pavucontrol pavumeter paman paprefs


OK.... I think I understand now.


0. put this in ~/.asoundrc

pcm.pulse {
  type pulse
}

ctl.pulse {
  type pulse
}

1. For SoDaRadio set the audio_in and audio_out to pulse

start SoDaRadio

2. for wsjtx select audio input and output as "pulse"

3. for fldigi select audio input and output as "pulse"


4. start pavucontrol

under playback and recording, set all devices to "loopback analog" stereo or mono
as appropriate. (recording is "monitor of loopback analog stereo"

configuration: loopback is Analog Stereo Output + Analog Mono Input

------------------------

Holy cow!   I think we can throw all this stuff away and just use
PulseAudio's pavucontrol program.


1. Start SoDaRadio normally.

2. Start fldigi
    configure fldigi
    configure->soundcard->audio->devices   PortAudio capture: Pulse   Playback: Pulse
    configure->soundcard->audio->settings  sample rate "native" for both.

3. start pavucontrol (this may only need to be done once?)

Working on "dynamic range" and related issues.

Above -47dBm input, the radio saturates and the noise floor
rises > 20dB.

Hmm... a little nonlinearity at the bottom.
But at 625kHz/16Kbuckets -- this is a 38 Hz bucket
Noise power in 38Hz is
-174dBm + 10*log10(38) = -174 + 16 = -158 dBm for the ideal noise floor.
Ours is measured at
-153, giving a noise figure of about 5dB.   Which is pretty darned close
to the spec.

Note though that our maximum signal before distortion is -47dBm and our
MDS is about -150, giving a dynamic range of 103dB.

That's about 17 bits of ADC accuracy.  We started out with 14 bits and
decimated by 100e6/625000 or 160.  log2(160) ~ 7.3 so we should get about
3 extra bits of dynamic range.    And we did.

BTW, the signal pretty much disappears on the waterfall at about -154 dBm
when the window length is 4, but I can see it down to about -157 with a
window length of 12.
