/**
 * @mainpage SoDaBench: Classes and a Server process to build a Linux USRP RF testbench
 *
 *
 * The SoDa RF Bench is a multi-threaded application
 * developed for the Linux operating system and the Ettus Radio USRP family
 * of SDR platforms. 
 *
 * SoDa was written and is maintained by Matt Reilly, kb1vc.
 *
 * @section structure Structure of the Radio
 *
 * The SoDa RF  program is partitioned into two parts:
 *
 * - the SDR controller program, called SoDaBenchServer
 * - the GUI program, called SoDaBench implemented in SoDaBench_Top
 *
 *
 * The GUI is built on the wxWidgets GUI toolset, and communicates
 * with the SDR control program via a Unix Domain socket connection.
 * The GUI and the SDR controller run on a single Linux host.
 *
 * The SDR signal processing and control functions are executed within
 * multiple threads of the SoDa application.  The threads communicate via
 * a simple mailbox-in-shared-memory communications scheme where each
 * thread can "subscribe" to one or more message streams, and place messages
 * into any message stream. (See SoDa::MultiMBox and SoDa::MBoxMessage)
 *
 * 
 *
 * The SoDa receiver architecture is a 3 stage heterodyne design.  
 * The first two IF conversions are performed within the USRP SDR platform.
 * The final stage of conversion is completed in the USRPRX module.
 * @see SoDa::USRPRX
 *
 * @image html SoDa_Radio_RX_Signal_Path.svg
 *
 * The reason for the three stage conversion scheme is threefold:
 * -# The first stage (Front End) LO is configured to operate in Integer-N
 *    synthesis mode. This reduces spurious "birdies" caused by harmonics of the
 *    reference oscillator divided by the fractional N denominator. 
 * -# The second stage LO is tuned to place the signal of interest at least
 *    50 kHz away from both the first and second local oscillators.  This
 *    ensures that the DC offset "spike" in the second IF stage is well away
 *    from the frequency of interest, and is not displayed in a waterfall or
 *    periodogram display.
 * -# by placing the second IF well away from the target frequency, we can
 *    put the target signal well off the skirts of the phase noise curves for
 *    both the first and second LOs. The third LO is implemented as a full
 *    32 bit floating point quadrature oscillator, so the quantization noise
 *    is comparatively low.
