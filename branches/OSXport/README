SoDa -- A Software Defined Radio for the Ettus Research USRP

Version 1.1.1

This package builds two programs: 

SoDaServer -- a multithreaded program that implements a software
defined multimode VHF/UHF transciever.  

SoDaRadio -- a GUI that offers a user interface to the controls
for SoDaServer

See the INSTALL file for instructions on configuring, building 
and installing SoDa

The doc directory contains a report on SoDa explaining its
construction and reason for being. It is not automatically built. 
cd to the doc directory and type "make".  If you have a reasonable
pdflatex installation and "inkscape" (an SVG authoring tool) 
the makefile will produce SoDa_Report.pdf
