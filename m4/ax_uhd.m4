# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_UHD([action-if-found], [action-if-not-found])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   This macro searches for an installed libuhd library. If nothing was
#   specified when calling configure, it searches first in /usr/local and
#   then in /usr, /opt/local and /sw. If the --with-uhd=DIR is specified,
#   it will try to find it in DIR/include/zlib.h and DIR/lib/libuhd.a. If
#   --without-uhd is specified, the library is not searched at all.
#
#   If either the header file (uhd/device.hpp) or the library (libuhd) is not found,
#   shell commands 'action-if-not-found' is run. If 'action-if-not-found' is
#   not specified, the configuration exits on error, asking for a valid uhd
#   installation directory.
#
#   If both header file and library are found, shell commands
#   'action-if-found' is run. If 'action-if-found' is not specified, the
#   default action appends '-I${UHD_HOME}/include' to CPFLAGS, appends
#   '-L${UHD_HOME}/lib' to LDFLAGS, prepends '-lz' to LIBS, and calls
#   AC_DEFINE(HAVE_UHD). You should use autoheader to include a definition
#   for this symbol in a config.h file. Sample usage in a C/C++ source is as
#   follows:
#
#     #ifdef HAVE_UHD
#     #include <uhd/device.hpp>
#     #endif /* HAVE_UHD */
