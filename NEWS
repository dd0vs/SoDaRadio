SVN 143 (trunk) Fixed numerous thread/fork related problems in the GUI. 

SVN 120 (trunk) Added display of native RX freq range to top bar of the radio.

SVN 119 (trunk) Added display of current RX antenna to status bar.

SVN 116 (branch TuneStep)  Changed the RX tuning in this rev so that
the integer-N mode picks the nearest integer-N frequency that is 1MHz
below the target. (See USRPCtrl::getNearestStep() )  This is done 
from a map built at startup time. (See USRPCtrl::initStepMap ). 

Also re-arranged RX freq setting code for the B2xx series.  This may 
eliminate the spectrum display problems as the tuning is swept....
