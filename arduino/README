This directory contains an arduino sketch to
manage external TR and bandswitching.

N200ArdProMini_TR

  This is a sketch that listens on the N200's 115 kBaud 
serial port (normally the serial port listening on socket
49172) on J312.  This port is otherwise used for the GPSDO
module.  If you need the GPSDO module, then this sketch
isn't goint to help you.

  (Though there IS a second RS232 port on the module at J311.
However, this serial port is programmed to run at 230kB.  At
that rate, the arduino cant create a reliable baud clock --
it is more than 8% off from nominal.)

	
   The configuration is tested against an Arduino UNO or ProMini and
an 8 relay module. It is used to do TR switching for SoDaRadio.


TRSequencer

  This is a digispark program ( http://digistump.com ) to listen
to an incoming PTT (ground to talk) line and sequence four output
relays one-after-another to

       a) Switch an external T/R relay from R to T.
       b) Enable the transmit side of a transverter.
       c) Apply 12V (or other) power to an external
       amplifier.
       d) ground a transmit enable line (for a DEM 2W power
       amplifier.

When the PTT line is released, the sequence reverses.

The PTT line is sensed with an optoisolator that is powered
from a local 5V regulator.
