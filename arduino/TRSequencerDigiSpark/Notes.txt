after short warmup, inductive pickup in box hears a strong
tone at 144.9 about 30dB above the ambient (ambient measured with
box powered off.)

This is the 9th harmonic of a 16.1 MHz oscillator that seems to be
RC as it is very very broad -- about 20kHz wide at the 3dB point...

This takes a while to settle after power on, and then wanders around
over a 20+kHz range.  It raises the local noise floor by more than
10dB.

Changed to a sleep mode/interrupt scheme and now
the 16MHz thing is gone.

Noise floor around 16 MHz rises by about 15dB when the power
widget is plugged in.  But there is no particular spur, just the
atmospherics in the room...
