  A Sequenced T/R Switch 
  
  This sketch senses a HIGH on pin 4 to indicate TRANSMIT
  mode.  (More on this later.) 
  
  On sensing "TRANSMIT" the controller will turn on relay 1
  connected to pin 5.  This should be used to activate
  the RF T/R relay or waveguide switch.   At the same time
  the controller will send a servo command on pin 3 (a PWM
  output) that can be used to drive a servo connected to a 
  waveguide switch.
  
  After a delay of TR2TVRT milliseconds, the controller will
  turn on relay 2 connected to pin 6.  This can be used to 
  activate the transmit side of a transverter. 
  
  After a delay of TVRT2AMP milliseconds, the controller will
  turn on relay 3 connected to pin 7.  This can be used to 
  activate a transmit amplifier. 
  
  Once the TRANSMIT mode sequence has begun, the controller
  will ignore the pin 4 input until the amplifier relay has
  been activated and AMP2REPOLL milliseconds have elapsed. 
  
  On sensing a LOW on pin 4, the controller initiates the
  sequence to get us into receive mode. 
  
  First, the amplifier relay (relay 3 on pin 7) is turned 
  off after a delay of RX2AMP milliseconds. 
  
  Then after a delay of AMP2TVRT milliseconds, relay 2 on 
  pin 6 is turned off. 
  
  Then after a delay of TVRT2TR milliseconds, relay 1 on 
  pin 5 is turned off, and the servo is returned to its
  0 setting.
