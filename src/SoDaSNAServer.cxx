/**
 * @mainpage SoDaSNA: Classes and a Server process to build a Linux USRP Scalar Network Analyzer
 *
 *
 * @li SoDa::USRPCtrl executes all control and status functions on the USRP
 * @li SoDa::USRPSNARX manages the inbound IF signal stream from the USRP receive chain
 * @li SoDa::USRPSNATX manages the outbound IF signal stream to the USRP transmit chain
 * @li SoDa::SimpleUI waits for requests and CW text on the UDP socket from the GUI, and forwards status and
 * The SoDa receiver architecture is a 3 stage heterodyne design.  
 * The first two IF conversions are performed within the USRP SDR platform.
 * The final stage of conversion is completed in the USRPSNARX module.
 * @see SoDa::USRPSNARX
 *
 * @image html SoDa_Radio_RX_Signal_Path.svg
 *
 * The reason for the three stage conversion scheme is threefold:
 * -# The first stage (Front End) LO is configured to operate in Integer-N
 *    synthesis mode. This reduces spurious "birdies" caused by harmonics of the
 *    reference oscillator divided by the fractional N denominator. 
 * -# The second stage LO is tuned to place the signal of interest at least
 *    50 kHz away from both the first and second local oscillators.  This
 *    ensures that the DC offset "spike" in the second IF stage is well away
 *    from the frequency of interest, and is not displayed in a waterfall or
 *    periodogram display.
 * -# by placing the second IF well away from the target frequency, we can
 *    put the target signal well off the skirts of the phase noise curves for
 *    both the first and second LOs. The third LO is implemented as a full
 *    32 bit floating point quadrature oscillator, so the quantization noise
 *    is comparatively low.

 * 
 * @section SNAProcess The SNA Control and Signal Flow
 *
 * The GUI sends a start command
 * SNA_SCAN_START <start-freq> <end-freq> <freq-step> <time-per-step> 
 *
 * This passes to the UI unit that passes the SCAN_START command onto 
 * the Ctrl unit which sets the TX and RX frequencies to an even 
 * FS MHz step that is at below <start-freq>  .
 * FS is 3 * sample-rate / 4. The initial FE freq is 3/8 *sample-rate 
 * above <start-freq>.
 *
 * On receiving a SCAN_INIT <start-freq> command, 
 * The TX Unit then transmits a signal at <start-freq> by imposing a 
 * -nkHz tone on the carrier via a USB modulator. It then puts a 
 * SNA_TX_CURFREQ <current-freq> command on the command bus.
 *
 * The RX unit waits for the SNA_TX_CURFREQ and demodulates the incoming
 * stream waiting for the incoming frequency -- it beats <current-freq>
 * against the stream, passes it through an LPF, and measures the amplitude. 
 * When the amplitude is stable, the RX unit sends SNA_RX_SENSE <current-freq> <amplitude>.
 *
 * When the TX unit gets SNA_RX_SENSE, it bumps the tone frequency by <freq-step>
 * and if <freq-step> is less than sample-rate / 4, it sends SAN_TX_CURFREQ. 
 * When <freq-step> gets to sample-rate / 4, it sends a SCAN_BUMP CMD
 *
 * The Ctrl gets the SCAN_BUMP command and sets the TX and RX oscillators
 * to current_fe_freq + FS.  Then it sends a SCAN_BUMP REPORT to RX and TX. 
 *
 * As a check: let's assume it takes 50mS to reset the FE oscillator. 
 * Then if the sample rate is 10MS/s we reset the FE in 7.5 MHz steps. 
 * A 1GHz wide sweep would take 133 steps.  This will take 6.7 seconds.
 * This is a bit long, so we might instead step the FE analog oscillator
 * in 22.5 MHz steps and move the DDC oscillator in 7.5 MHz steps.
